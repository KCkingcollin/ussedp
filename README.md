Instructions for using the linux auto compile scripts...

## **DEPENDENCIES**

Most of it you will already have (exept dotnet-sdk)

### **You Will Need...**

#1: `git`

#2: `dotnet-sdk`(**NOT THE SNAP**)

#3: `wget`

#4: `7z`

#5: `rsync`

#6: `zenity`

## **Installaton/ Usage**

step 1: Download the script to your **home** directory

step 2: Open the **terminal** and run `sudo chmod +x ~/"TheNameOfTheScriptYouDownloaded".sh`

step 4: Aside from needing your password everything is automatic past this point assuming you have all the dependencies installed the script will, download, install, and launch all on its own and if you need to open it up in the future there will be an **executable script** (`ussedp-BestOfBothWorlds.sh` or `ussedp-FullPatcher.sh`) right in the **home** directory so no need to go hunting...
