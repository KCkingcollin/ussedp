# For Linux Users...

Instructions for using the linux auto compile scripts...

## **DEPENDENCIES**

Most of it you will already have **(Exept `dotnet-sdk`)**

### **You Will Need...**

#1: `git`

#2: `dotnet-sdk`**(NOT THE SNAP)**

#3: `wget`

#4: `7z`

#5: `rsync`

#6: `zenity`

#7: `gksu`

## **Installaton/ Usage**

**Step 1**: Download the fork ether with `git clone https://github.com/KCkingcollin/ussedp` (In the **terminal**) or **Click** [**HERE**](https://github.com/KCkingcollin/ussedp/archive/refs/heads/linux-main.zip) to **download** the zip file and just **extract** the files somewhere on your computer

**Step 2**: Find the file `USSEDP-GUI-Linux.sh` and jsut **double click** that file to open the **GUI** **(If your distro doesn't support file manager execution youll need to run the script in the terminal with `/"TheLocationOfYourGitFiles/USSEDP-GUI-Linux.sh`)**

**Step 3**: Pick how you want to **patch skyrim** in the **GUI** and type your **sudo password** in the next **prompt** that pops up

**Step 4**: Everything is **automatic** past this point assuming you have all the dependencies installed the script will, download, install, and launch all on its own and if you need to open it up in the future there will be an **executable script** (`ussedp-BestOfBothWorlds.sh` or `ussedp-FullPatcher.sh`) right in the **home** directory so no need to go hunting, **unless its in Skyrim!! ^^**
