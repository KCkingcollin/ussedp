so normal script stuff...

### **DEPENDENCIES**

most of it you will already have (exept dotnet-sdk)

you will need...

#1: `git`

#2: `dotnet-sdk`(**NOT THE SNAP**)

#3: `wget`

#4: `7z`

#5: `rsync`

### **Installaton/ Usage**

step 1: download the script to your home directory

step 2: open the command line and run `sudo chmod +x ~/"TheNameOfTheScriptYouDownloaded".sh`

step 3: Just run it with `./"TheNameOfTheScriptYouDownloaded".sh`

step 4: aside from needing your password everything is automatic past this point assuming you have all the dependencies installed the script will, download, install, and launch all on its own and if you need to open it up in the future there will be an executable link right in the home directory
